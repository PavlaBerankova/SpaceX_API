# SpaceX Mobile App

SpaceX is a mobile application developed in SwiftUI for iOS. The app displays information about SpaceX uploaded using the API. This is the first version. I want to gradually add more screens to the app showing more data about SpaceX.

## What this project taught me

 - API
 - async, await


## How to Download and Test the App

To download and test the SpaceX app on your local machine using GitHub and Xcode, follow these steps:

1. Install Xcode on your Mac. You can download Xcode from the Mac App Store or from the Apple Developer website.

2. Open Terminal on your Mac and go (create) to the folder to which you want to clone the project

3. Clone the SpaceX repository by running the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/PavlaBerankova/SpaceX_API.git
   ```

4. Open the project in Xcode, select a simulator from the device menu or connect your physical iOS device.

5. Build and run the application by clicking the "Play" button or pressing `Cmd + R`.

6. The SpaceX app will launch in the simulator or on your connected iOS device, allowing you to play the game and test its features.
